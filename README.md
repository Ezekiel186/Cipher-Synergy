# Cipher-Synergy

## Description
[Visit Deployed Site](https://ezekiel186.github.io/Cipher-Synergy/)

Cipher Synergy is a two player escape room website. Tackle a series of mind-bending puzzles and challenges. This website was inspired from Enchambered, Live Escape Room Adventure's [Alone Together](https://www.enchambered.com/puzzles/alone-together/). This project was born out of a passion for coding and puzzle-solving, developed by a recent graduate of U.C. Berkeley's full stack coding bootcamp. This is my very first personal project outside of the bootcamp.

## How to Play
Have each player on seperate devices. make sure you and your friend can communicate with each other wheather you're both in the same room, or long distance on call. Then, each of you will have to choose which player you want to be. You cannot both be player 1, or both player 2. Once youre ready click the player buttons to start the game. Remember you CAN NOT show your screen to your friend, you can however describe what you're seing. The key to solving the puzzles is communication, so describe items and symbols as best you can. To make this even more challenging consider setting a timer for one hour, and try to beat all the puzzles before the timer goes off. The game ends once both players have escaped their respective rooms.
