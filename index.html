                <h1>How to play</h1>
                Have two devices and a friend to play the game with you, make sure you and your friend can communicate with each other wheather you're both in the same room, or long distance on call.
                Then, each of you will have to choose which player they want to be. You cannot both be player 1, or both player 2. There can only be one player 1, and one player 2.
                Once youre ready click the player buttons to start the game, Remember you CAN NOT show your screen to your friend, you can however describe what you're seing. The key to solving the puzzles is communication, so describe items and symbols as best you can.
                To make this even more challenging consider setting a timer for one hour, and try to beat all the puzzles before the timer goes off. The game ends once both players have escaped their respective rooms.

                <h1>What is Cipher Synergy</h1>
                Cypher Synergy is an online escape room made to be played by two people. Tackle a series of mind-bending puzzles and challenges. This website was inspired from Enchambered, Live Escape Room Adventure's <a href="https://www.enchambered.com/puzzles/alone-together/">Alone Together</a>.
                 This project was born out of a passion for coding and puzzle-solving, developed by a recent graduate of U.C. Berkeley's full stack coding bootcamp.
